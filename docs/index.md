# To-Do service API

The truth starts (and, currently, ends) on this page.

## API reference docs

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service.

When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.

* [user resource](api/user)
* [task resource _(coming soon)_](#api-reference-docs)
